Alright, here’s a **top-tier GitHub README.md** for your **Airis** project.
It’s structured like a professional open-source AI automation framework repo, so it’ll make your project look clean and legit.

```markdown
# Airis — OS-Level AI Automation Layer

> **Airis** is an intelligent automation framework that fuses **low-level system control in C** with **high-level reasoning from LLaMA 3**.  
> Think *Siri meets OS kernel hooks* — fully local, privacy-preserving, and capable of automating your machine at the deepest level.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Machine State Monitoring** in C (CPU, RAM, active processes, etc.)
- **AI Decision Making** via LLaMA 3 (Ollama) for contextual, human-like reasoning
- **Two-Way Communication** between C (executor) and Python (AI brain) over a REST API
- **Local Execution** — No cloud dependencies, your data never leaves your machine
- **Extensible Actions** — Add your own commands, scripts, or automations
- **Cross-Platform Potential** — Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with minor tweaks)

## 🛠 Architecture

```

┌───────────────────────────┐       ┌─────────────────────────┐
│   C System Monitor         │  ---> │ Python AI Agent (Flask) │
│  (Low-level OS Hooks)      │       │   + LLaMA 3 via Ollama  │
└───────────────────────────┘       └─────────────────────────┘
↑                                     ↓
└────────────── AI Decision  ─────────┘

````

**Flow:**
1. **C Program** collects system metrics & state.
2. Sends them to the **Python Agent** via HTTP POST.
3. **Python Agent** prompts **LLaMA 3 (Ollama)** with state & user intent.
4. AI responds with a specific action decision.
5. **C Program** parses the decision and executes system commands.

## 📦 Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

**System Requirements**
- C compiler (GCC / Clang)
- Python 3.9+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with LLaMA 3 pulled locally

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull LLaMA 3
ollama pull llama3
````

**Python Requirements**

```bash
pip install flask requests
```

**C Requirements**

* `libcurl` for HTTP requests
  Install via:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev   # Ubuntu/Debian
  brew install curl                       # macOS
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ Build & Run

**Start the AI Agent**

```bash
python3 ai_agent.py
```

**Compile and Run the C Monitor**

```bash
gcc monitor_and_decide.c -o monitor_ai -lcurl
./monitor_ai
```

## 💡 Example Interaction

**C sends:**

```
Machine State: CPU 85%, RAM 72%, chrome.exe active
User Input: optimize performance
```

**AI decides:**

```
Close Chrome to free CPU and RAM
```

**C executes:**

```bash
pkill chrome
```

---

## 🛠 Extending Airis

* **Add More System Metrics** in C (disk usage, network I/O, GPU load)
* **Custom AI Actions** — map AI decisions to shell commands
* **Multi-Agent Mode** — different AI models for different tasks

---

## ⚠ Disclaimer

Airis can execute system-level commands. Use responsibly — actions like `rm -rf /` will destroy your system.
Run in a sandboxed environment if testing dangerous automations.

If you want, I can also make **fancy ASCII logos and badges** at the top so it looks like a polished commercial-grade AI framework.  
Do you want me to do that next?
